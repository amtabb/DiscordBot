1.) GET A DB system set-up for the bot to use
    Possible Options:
      SQLITE
        -I feel like we can have an easier time if we use SQLITE instead of MONGODB
        
      MONGODB



3) slap, punch, hug command which tags both author user & and user mentioned. let's also give it a nice background with a color as seen on yui bot when u use the command slap & hug = DONE 
new task: create make the bot recognize display_user [in process]

5)create reminder command, daily reminders placed specially in the server that it's asked.

6) Make a constant.py file to store constant variables used in the project such as the Hatsuki guild id for ease of use and readability

7.) ADD ABSTRACTION TO MAKING EMBEDS BY CONVERTING IT INTO A FUNCTION.

FINISHED TASKS:

4) Have properties be printed in the console when a user sends a message
for ex:
[User] = SomeUser
[Id_of_User] = #0000
[Message] = message.content
[Channel] = message.channel
this'll make implementing chat-related stuff easier I think and would always make sure the bot is receiving the variables

2.) Convert bot.events IF-ELSE blocks into one big method if possible and move it to a seperate .py file to import to main


SOLVED: BY MAKING AN INDEPENDENT COG FOR IT

comments: initially it was supposed to be a method but issues with varying returns such as a message string, emoji, or even an "add reaction" to messages would be hard to implement without the help of the python API wrapper.
